  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Software Engineer with 4.5+ years of experience in Perl development, automation scripting, and healthcare domain workflows. Specialized in claim and billing systems with strong experience in data parsing, SQL integration, Agile delivery, and production support. Currently working with CitiusTech for the Athenahealth client, contributing to robust backend systems. Recognized consistently for high-quality performance across roles.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>One of the key projects I led was the <strong>Claim Automation Suite</strong> at Athenahealth. I designed and developed an end-to-end automation framework in Perl that streamlined the validation and processing of healthcare claims. The system automatically validated incoming claim data against business rules, performed data corrections, and flagged exceptions. It used MySQL for data retrieval and updates, integrated logging mechanisms for audit tracking, and sent alerts for claims requiring manual intervention. This project led to a 30% increase in efficiency, significantly reducing manual efforts, improving billing accuracy, and accelerating the claim lifecycle from intake to submission.</p>

  <p>Another major contribution was the <strong>Metadata Crawler Platform</strong> for publishing clients, where I built robust Python scrapers using BeautifulSoup with advanced proxy management, retry logic, and FTP-based deployment. The system achieved over 99% accuracy and ensured timely delivery of metadata to downstream systems, enhancing editorial turnaround time by 35%.</p>

  <p>I also developed an <strong>E-Commerce Price Monitoring Engine</strong> using Selenium, Python, and Regex to scrape pricing and availability data from over 50 online retailers. Integrated with cron jobs and real-time alerting, this system provided daily insights into market trends, enabling business stakeholders to respond proactively to competitive changes.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>CitiusTech ‚Äì Software Engineer (Dec 2023 ‚Äì Present)</h3>
<p>At CitiusTech, I play a pivotal role in streamlining the billing and claims automation infrastructure for the Athenahealth platform. My day-to-day responsibilities include designing and refining Perl scripts to drive core automation processes, from data validation to billing logic execution. I‚Äôve architected reusable modules that improve the efficiency of MySQL-based data pipelines and reduce development redundancy. Working in a hybrid Agile environment, I contribute to sprint planning, retrospectives, and daily sync-ups while managing task workflows in Jira. Additionally, I collaborate with QA engineers and business analysts to proactively resolve production incidents and enhance performance. My work has directly contributed to reducing error rates and boosting the speed of the billing lifecycle.</p>
        <h3>Straive ‚Äì Junior Executive (Dec 2021 ‚Äì Nov 2023)</h3>
<p><strong>Project:</strong> CAR ‚Äì Journal Metadata Extraction & Automation<br>
At Straive (formerly SPi Global), I worked on developing Perl and Python scripts to extract structured metadata such as DOI, title, authors, publication year, and download full-text PDFs from academic publisher websites. I created reusable modules to reduce time spent on repetitive scraping logic across various publishers. My work involved automating workflows that inserted cleaned metadata into MySQL databases and deployed production-ready scripts on remote servers. I also implemented proxy-based logic to prevent IP blocking and ensured stability across long-running data pulls. Outputs were validated and shared with the QC team daily. Once approved, the scripts were transitioned to automated scheduling using FTP and cron jobs.
</p>
        <h3>Mobius ‚Äì Trainee Software Engineer (Jan 2021 ‚Äì Dec 2021)</h3>
<p><strong>Project:</strong> ONS Consumer Pricing ‚Äì E-commerce Data Aggregation<br>
At Mobius, I was part of a team responsible for scraping and aggregating consumer product data like price, brand, and specifications from global e-commerce platforms. I built generic scraping modules that supported multiple websites with minimal configuration, greatly reducing duplication and maintenance overhead. The collected data was validated and uploaded to MySQL databases and FTP directories for client use. Additionally, I implemented comparison logic that ran daily to detect price anomalies, automatically triggering email alerts if discrepancies were found. This helped maintain data integrity and led to continued client trust and project renewal.
